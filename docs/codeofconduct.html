		<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

		<p>In order to foster an inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and
			cooperative community, the core team tries to enforce this code of
			conduct on our open source projects.</p>

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical
			boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in thoughtbot’s
			project codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, mailing lists, meetups,
			and other events. Violators will be warned by the core team. Repeat
			violations will result in being blocked or banned by the core team at
			or before the 3rd violation.</p>

		<h2>In detail</h2>

		<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender
			identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
			appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate
			intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual
			attention.</p>

		<p>Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
			to comply immediately.</p>

		<p>Maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>

		<p>If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers,
			we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the
			offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase
			and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.</p>

		<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
			harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the
			core team or email xxx@yyy.zzz immediately.</p>

		<p>We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the
			project codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, and mailing lists.</p>

		<p>Finally, don’t forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all
			do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn
			from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.</p>
