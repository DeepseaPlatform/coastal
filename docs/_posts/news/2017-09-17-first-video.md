We have just released the first COASTAL video.  It explains how to install Z3,
which a critical library that COASTAL uses to generate new inputs values.
(Although it is possible to run COASTAL without Z3, it is not easy, and this
installing Z3 is highly recommended.)  The video covers OS X, Linux, and
Windows.
